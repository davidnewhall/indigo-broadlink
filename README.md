# Indigo Broadlink Plugin

This plugin allows you to control the Broadlink RM Pro+ with Indigo.
If you want to send me more Broadlink devices, I'll add support for them. I
currently only own a RM Pro+ because [oceanplexian](https://github.com/oceanplexian)
purchased it for me and asked me to make a plugin.

## Devices

- [RM Pro+](https://www.amazon.com/Broadlink-RM33-RM-Pro-Automation/dp/B078W1JVYK)
- [RM3 Mini3](https://www.amazon.com/Broadlink-RM33-RM-Pro-Automation/dp/B078BCMZH6)

## Future

- [A1 Environment Sensors](http://www.ibroadlink.com/a1/)
